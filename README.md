# DiscordGroupRemover
Good for Removing Spammed Groups on Discord. ( I made this because a kid was spam adding me into groups on Discord )

Make sure to unfriend the person adding you to the group before executing this to prevent any more spam.


Basically just uses ur discord token and when you type "start" on discord it just deletes ***ALL*** the group chats you are in and prints out how many it removed.


You can use this if a kid spam adds you to a group, it will leave all groups ur in automatically.
